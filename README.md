My Project: Car Searching

Description:
For my final project, I chose to create an n-ary tree that contains the cars available in the Colorado region. The user will be asked to enter the name of a car company and from there, choose the model. Then, the system will display the cost, year and mileage that was found in the Colorado region. If the user wants to sell a car, they must simply input the information about the car and it will be added to the tree.
