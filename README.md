My Project: Superheroes

Description:
For my final project, I chose to create a hash table that will utilize the user's name to create a super hero after processing the first and last name through a hash function. Each super hero name is made up of two words in which the user's first name determines the index of the hash table to go to and the last name determines where to go in the linked list. This process is repeated, although slightly differently, to get the second super hero name. After discovering the super hero name, the additional info about the character can then be given by using other hash tables. Another hash function will then be used to give a unique super power, weakness, catch phrase, as well as label other hero/villain friends and foes! 

To Run:
- Simply select the 1. option first to create your super name
- From there, you are then able to access any of the remaining options in the given menu
